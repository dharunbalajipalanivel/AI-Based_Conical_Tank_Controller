# AI-Based Conical Tank Controller  

This project implements an AI-based controller using a neural network to predict the **Kp** and **Ki** values for a conical tank system.  

## Features  
- Uses a **neural network** to predict controller parameters.  
- Normalizes input data for better learning.  
- Implements **backpropagation** with a sigmoid activation function.  
- Allows users to input a setpoint and receive optimized **Kp** and **Ki** values.  

## Usage  
1. Run the MATLAB script.  
2. Enter a setpoint when prompted.  
3. The script predicts and displays the **Kp** and **Ki** values for that setpoint.  

## Requirements  
- MATLAB  
- Basic knowledge of control systems and neural networks
